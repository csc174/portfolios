        <p> Hi! My name is <strong>Melanie Dookharan</strong> and I'm currently a junior at the University of Rochester, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business. I'm particularly interested in UX/UI design and applications in Human Computer Interactions. I self learned Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator in 6th grade for a project, and have longed for a career where I can focus on design since then. After taking computer science courses for a little over a year, I am proficient in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. I'm excited to combine my skills for a long-term career. Eventually, I hope to exclusively work on websites and mobile interfaces, but focus on the research and design side of it. </p>
